Host: "The first God of War game was released in 2005, developed by Sony Santa Monica Studio. The game introduced us to Kratos, a Spartan warrior who serves the Olympian gods, but soon discovers that he's been deceived and used as a pawn in their game of power. The game's success spawned a trilogy, with God of War II and III, which further explored the world of Greek mythology and Kratos' quest for revenge against the gods."

This game marked a significant departure from the previous trilogy, with a new setting in Norse mythology, a more personal story, and a fresh start for Kratos. The game received widespread critical acclaim, and is widely considered one of the best games of all time."
